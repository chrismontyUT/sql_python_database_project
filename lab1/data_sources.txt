Lab 1: description of datasets

1. Watchlist.csv
Organization that published the data sets: International Movie Database(IMDB)
File format of dataset: csv
Attribute/description: contains list of top 250 movies with corresponding titles, 
release year, IMDB rating, runtime, genres, and directors. We plan on making "Movie", 
"Genre", "IMBD Stats", and "Director" as entity classes with corresponding attrbutes.
The "title" attribute for Movie and IMDB Stats will likely be the primary key.  
An interesting aspect of our dataset is that we will need junction tables for the 
many to many relationships. These junction tables will be for movie-director and 
movie-genre.
